- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that jellyfish are immortal in a way? The species Turritopsis dohrnii, known as the "immortal jellyfish," has the unique ability to reverse its life cycle, returning to its juvenile stage after reaching maturity. This means that, theoretically, they can repeat this process indefinitely and never die of old age.
